    <h2>4 Easy Steps to Satay Perfection! </h2>

    <h6>
        <li>
            Make the marinade. Combine coconut milk, soy sauce, lime juice, brown sugar, curry
            powder,
            ground
            coriander, ground ginger, minced garlic, sriracha and fish sauce in a bowl.
        </li>
        <li>
            Marinate the chicken. Add two pounds of cubed boneless, skinless chicken breasts to
            the
            marinade,
            toss
            the chicken in the marinade until it’s well coated. Place in the refrigerator to
            marinate
            for 30
            minutes.
            This chicken is honestly so flavorful and tender after just a 30 minute marinade,
            but if
            you
            want to
            make it
            earlier, you can leave the chicken in the marinade for up to 4 hours.
        </li>
        <li>
            Skewer the chicken. If using wooden skewers, soak the skewers in water for 30
            minutes
            before
            preparing
            the skewers. This will prevent the skewers from catching fire on the grill, pretty
            important
            stuff!
            Remove
            the chicken from the marinade and discard the marinating liquid. Skewer 4-5 pieces
            of
            marinated
            chicken onto
            skewers. You’ll need 10-12 metal skewers or soaked wooden skewers.
        </li>
        <li>
            Grill the chicken. Turn on a grill to high heat. Cooking these skewers quickly over
            high
            heat
            will give
            them a wonderful sear on the outside, while keeping them juicy and tender in the
            middle!
            Place
            the
            skewers
            on the grill over high heat for 3-4 minutes, flip and grill for an additional 3-4
            minutes.
            Remove
            from the
            grill and top with fresh cilantro, if you’d like.

        <p>Thai Peanut Sauce</p>
        <blockquote>
            – while this is optional, it’s also pretty standard to find chicken satay paired with peanut sauce.
            They
            really are a match made in heaven!
        </blockquote>
        <p> Lettuce Leaves</p>
        <blockquote>
            - chicken satay is delicious served as a lettuce wrap. Simply use a fork to remove the chicken from
            the
            skewers and place it right in an iceberg, butter or romaine lettuce leaf. Drizzle with a little
            peanut
            sauce
            and you’ve got a light, healthy meal!
        </blockquote>
        <p> Fresh Veggies</p>
        <blockquote>
            – as I mentioned above, I served the chicken satay with a fresh veggie tray from Vons and extra Thai
            peanut
            sauce for dipping the veggies. The chicken and veggie combo was light, yet still filling enough for
            a
            meal
            and it gave me the opportunity to dip two things into that absolutely delicious peanut sauce!
        </blockquote>
        <p>Stir Fried Veggies </p>
        <blockquote>
            – while the chicken is marinating, you can take that time to stir fry up your favorite veggies, like
            broccoli, bell peppers, onions and sugar snap peas.
        </blockquote>
        <p> Asian Salad</p>
        <blockquote>
            – for an easy side, grab a bagged Asian chopped salad in the produce section at your local Vons, to
            pair
            with the chicken skewers. Cooked Rice or Quinoa – for a more filling side, serve the chicken satay
            with
            a
            side of cooked white rice, brown rice or quinoa.
